    <p><strong>Decentralized storage systems </strong> are a type of data storage system that operate on a network of independent nodes, rather than relying on a centralized server or data center. In a decentralized storage system, data is distributed across a network of nodes, which may be located anywhere in the world. Each node in the network stores a portion of the data, and the system as a whole functions as a peer-to-peer network.</p>

        <h3>IPFS</h3>
        <p>
          PFS is a peer-to-peer protocol for sharing and storing files on a distributed network.
          <br> <br>
          It uses content-addressed hyperlinks to allow nodes in the network to locate and retrieve files.<br> <br>
          IPFS is designed to be decentralized, meaning there is no single point of failure or control.<br> <br>
          It can be used to store and distribute any type of file, including text, images, videos, and application code.

        <h3>File coin</h3>
        <p>Filecoin is a decentralized storage network that allows users to store and retrieve data in a peer-to-peer manner, using a cryptocurrency called FIL as an incentive mechanism for miners to provide storage space.
          <br> <br>
          It was founded in 2014 by Juan Benet and is built on top of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) protocol.
          <br> <br>
          Filecoin's storage network is designed to be secure, resilient, and censorship-resistant. The network is made up of independent storage providers who compete to provide the best storage and retrieval services to users.
          Users can use FIL to pay for storage on the network and miners can earn FIL for providing storage and retrieval services.<br></p>

    <h1>Decentralization</h1>
    <div class="detail-2">
        <img src="images\download.png" alt="" srcset="">
        <p><strong>Decentralization</strong>   is the concept of distributing power, decision-making authority, and control away from a central authority or organization and dispersing it among a network of individuals or entities. In a decentralized system, there is no single point of control, and instead, decision-making is distributed across the network.
